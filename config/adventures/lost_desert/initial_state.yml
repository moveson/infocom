locations:
- id: salt_flats
  name: salt flats
  description:
    general: A vast, flat landscape of dry, cracked tiles. Only the smallest breeze can be felt in the hot sun.
    tiles: The tiles appear to be made of dried salt, created by the drying and cracking of the flat.

  name: great dunes
  description:
    general: Massive sandy dunes loom before you, shifting slightly in the wind.
    dunes: The sand dunes make a hissing noise as they shift, but that isn't the only thing hissing. A large cobra seems to be guarding it's nest.
    cobra: It's forked tongue slithers in and out of bared fangs. Another loud hiss signals it doesn't take visitors very kindly...

  name: stone ruins
  description:
    general: Mossy boulders and pillars surround you, some of them carved with engravings.
    stone: As you look closer, you see that the stone is covered in markings, resembling some sort of ancient writing.
    engravings: The markings resemble humans bowing down and giving offerings to snake-like creatures, which they seemed to worship.

- id: mossy_temple
  name: ruinous temple
  description:
    general: A large, stone structure resembling some sort of ancient temple.
    temple: The building is falling apart, and only one front pillar remains intact. You also notice a glass bottle sitting in front of the temple.
    pillar: Cracks run through the carved stone, and it seems like the pillar won't hold for much longer. You can make out rough pictures of snakes embellished in the stone.
    bottle: Interestingly enough, the bottle is engraved with the same riddle the stone had, but contains a new verse as well.

- id: willow_forest
  name: weeping willow forest
  description:
    general: A peaceful grove of blossoming willow trees lay before you, swaying in the cool breeze.
    trees: The trees are all closely packed together, and a pair of snow boots lay nestled in one of the tree's thick roots.
    boots: The old boots are tattered and worn, but still look usable for good traction in snowy terrain.

  name: snowy mountains
  description:
    general: High, icy peaks tower above the clouds, and freezing wind pelts you from all directions.
    peaks: Higher than any other mountains you've seen before, these peaks are truly a magnificent sight. You also notice a chest up above you on a small ledge sticking out from the mountainside.
    chest: The chest looks very battered and wet, but the chest's thick oak casing and heavy metal lock seem to be standing up to the wind very well.

    visible: false
    reactions:
      get: You reach out to grab the writhing serpent, but it recoils and spits venom at you.
